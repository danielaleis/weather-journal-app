# Weather Journal App Project

Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree - Project 3: 
Weather Journal App. 

This project required me to create an asynchronous web app with javascript that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

My weather app askes the user his zip-code, to determine the location. If the entered zip is not five digits long, an alert will be triggered. The user also needs to enter his feelings in the textarea, which will be displayed under the weather-info in the "your weather" area of the app. 

The weather data is coming from openweathermap and I used their FAQ and parameter list to choose which data to get and then display.
